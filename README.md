# cordova-plugin-crypto-random

Native cryptographically secure random bytes.

## Installation

Install from the TransferChain GitHub repository:

```sh
cordova plugin add https://github.com/TransferChain/cordova-plugin-crypto-random
```

Wait for Cordova's deviceready event before calling CryptoKit.Random. This
package targets Android and iOS; it does not provide a browser fallback. The
command targets the GitHub repository; repository publication is managed
separately. This document does not imply an npm release is available.

## iOS validation status

iOS testing is ongoing. Progress and validation updates will be shared
regularly. XCTest sources are available, but macOS/Xcode execution has not yet
been completed; verified iOS security behavior is not claimed.

## Documentation

- [Usage, parameters and examples](docs/API.md)
- [Tests and verification](docs/TESTING.md)
- [Native implementation guide](DEVELOPMENT.md)

## Plugin entry point

After Cordova's `deviceready` event, access `window.CryptoKit.Random`. The
methods below belong to that plugin object. See [API examples](docs/API.md) for
parameters, results and cleanup.

The shared `CryptoKit` JavaScript namespace contains only the plugins you
install. Each package registers its own member without replacing its siblings.
This namespace is separate from Apple's native CryptoKit framework.

## API

```text
randomBytes(length)
```

See [the developer guide](DEVELOPMENT.md) for argument details, native
implementation, lifecycle, failure behavior and platform prerequisites. Length
is a byte count. Returned bytes belong to the caller; wipe owned secret output
after all operations using it have settled.

## Tests and development

Plugin test sources live under tests/. See [test setup](docs/TESTING.md) for the
suites included in this package and their harness requirements. Native checks
require the Android or Xcode toolchain. A host mock passing is not evidence that
Android or iOS device execution succeeded.

## Contributing

Read the [contribution guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md) for development setup,
coding conventions, regression tests and pull request expectations.

## Security

Recorded security-related regression results:

- Android emulator, 2026-10-06: binary random output and input-length bounds
  passed.
- Host bridge, 2026-10-08: numeric length forwarding and Uint8Array results
  passed. These checks do not certify statistical entropy; generation uses the
  native OS CSPRNG.

These are results from the dated validation runs, not a new execution for this
documentation update. Android results are emulator results; they do not
establish physical-device or iOS validation. Host mocks do not prove native
execution. Passing regressions are not a security audit or certification. See
[test setup and scope](docs/TESTING.md).

production credentials or secret values in reports or logs.
